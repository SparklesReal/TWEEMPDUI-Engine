# TWEEMPDUI-Engine
A game 2D game engine made in C++
This engine is made to be as memory efficent as botherd to make it for example im using C-style arrays and floats instead of doubles and other annoying stuff.
If you wonder what TWEEMPDUI stands for it stands for
**T**he
**W**orst
**E**ngine
**E**ver
**M**ade
**P**lease
**D**on't
**U**se
**I**t
And the name is also the first thing nothing else was named xD

DO NOT USE THIS IN THE CURRENT VERISON the game engine can load texture but not display them SO DON'T use this engine yet you can use it has insperation or develop it further, but DON'T make a game in it
